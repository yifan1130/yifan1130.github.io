Greetings! Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student at Siebel School of Computing and Data Science in University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. [Fan Lai](http://fanlai.me).

I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am very fortunate to work with Prof. [Tuo Zhao](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~tzhao80/). I am also very fortunate to spend a wonderful summer with Dr. [Yu Gan](https://gy1005.github.io/) and Prof. [Fan Lai](http://fanlai.me) as a student researcher in Systems Research@Google in summer 2024. 

My research interests lie in building efficient systems for supporting large language models and GenAI. 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
